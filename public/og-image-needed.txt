OG Image Recommendation
=======================

Default social image currently points to `/web-app-manifest-512x512.png`, so links no longer 404. For richer sharing previews, add a dedicated OG image and update the paths in `app/app.vue`.

Recommended specifications:
- Dimensions: 1200x630 pixels (standard OG image size)
- Format: PNG
- Content: Should include the CommunityFix branding and tagline
- Suggested file location: `/public/social-share.png`

This image will be used when sharing CommunityFix links on social media platforms.
